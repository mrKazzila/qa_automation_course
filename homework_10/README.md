## Goal:
- Practice using the socket module and network interaction over the HTTP protocol.

### Requirements

1. We implement our own echo server using the socket library.
2. Your server must accept the request from the client and send it to him:
   - headers received in the request
   - the method by which the request was made
   - set the status that the client passed in the GET status parameter
   - if the parameter is not passed or is not valid, then give 200
   - if the value is (optional), the server should not stop working after responding to the client, but continue to wait for the next connection
   - Headings should be displayed on the page as lines of text:
     - Request Method: GET
     - Request Source: ('127.0.0.1', 47296)
     - Response Status: 200 OK
     - header-name: header-value
     - header-name: header-value
     - ...

#### Launch:

1. Moving to the working directory.
```shell script
qa_automation_course>cd homework_10/echo_server
```

2. Running code
```shell script
qa_automation_course/homework_10/echo_server>python server.py
```
